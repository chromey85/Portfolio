            <h1>Why I joined CodeNation</h1>
                <p>I have always had an interest in electronics and computers, whereas I have been lazy in other aspects of electronics (soldiering, voltages, wattage ect) I have always kept up with computers, mainly the hardware side as I didn't know which avenue to take, did I want to be a front end developer? Back-end developer or full stack.
                    
                Now, when this opportunity was presented to me, I jumped at the opportunity to further my skills in the IT sector and hopefully by the end of this course, I will have a better understanding of which direction I will take.

            <h1>Week 1's Targets and Expectations</h1>
            <P>To be honest, I did not know what to expect in the beginning of this course apart for the fact that it was going to be fast and intense and BOY!!!! it lived up to its expectations and MORE!!!
            <br><br>
            Now that I am accustomed to the pace of the lectures, I look forward to the challenges that will be awaiting me in the coming weeks with open arms.
